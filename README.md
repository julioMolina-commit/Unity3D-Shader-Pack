# Unity3D-Shader-Pack
An old collection of shaders for the universal render pipeline with adjustable settings.

The effects are a tiling shader to scale textures for floors or walls, an outline filter, a pixelation filter and a dittering filter.

The filters are applied directly as screen effects and allow you to change multiple parameters such as outline color and margin detection for the outline or the light, dark and ditter color for the ditter filter.

All the shaders require only plugging them into the engine and making a material to customize the options, for the tilling you then apply it to an object, for the filters use the URP and add them as full screen effects.
